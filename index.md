    Revolutions - Industrial Policy and Industrialization in South Korea</strong></a><strong>
    (2021) - <em>Revise and Resubmit, Quarterly Journal of Economics </em><br></strong><br>[Previously
    titled: Manufacturing Revolutions - Industrial Policy and Networks in South Korea,
    2016]<strong><br>Abstract</strong> - I study the impact of industrial policy on
    industrial development by considering a canonical intervention. Following a political
    crisis, South Korea dramatically altered its development strategy with a sector-specific
    industrial policy: the Heavy Chemical and Industry (HCI) drive, 1973-1979. With
    newly assembled historical data, I use the sharp introduction and withdrawal of
    industrial policies to study the impacts of industrial policy—during and after
    the intervention period. I show (1) HCI promoted the expansion and dynamic comparative
    advantage of directly targeted industries. (2) Using variation in exposure to
    policies through the input-output network, I show HCI indirectly benefited downstream
    users of targeted intermediates. (3) I find direct and indirect benefits of HCI
    persisted even after the end of HCI, following the 1979 assassination of the president.
    These effects include the eventual development of directly targeted exporters
    and their downstream counterparts. Together, my findings suggest that the temporary
    drive shifted Korea manufacturing into more advanced markets and created durable
    industrial change. These findings clarify lessons drawn from South Korea and the
    East Asian growth miracle.<a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/aw7sq" title="The

    title="">Digging a deep hole: Why killing environmental activists is bad for business</a>)<br><strong>Abstract
    </strong>- Civil society is essential to governance, especially where laws and
    authority are weak. We study how a core strategy of international civil society
    groups - informing and publicizing human rights abuses - impacts those tied to
    abuse. Our study focuses on a major trend at the center of on-going international
    media campaigns: the assassination of civil society activists involved in mining
    activity. Collecting and coding 20 years of data on assassination events, we use
    Event Study Methodology to study how publicity of these events impact the asset
    prices of firms associated with abuse. We show that publicizing abuses has a significant
    impact on multinationals. Firms associated with an assassination have large, negative
    abnormal returns following the event. We calculate a median loss in market capitalisation
    of over 100 million USD, ten days following violence. We highlight the role of
    media publicity in our results. We show negative returns from assassinations are
    stronger during periods of low media pressure, versus when they coincide with
    competing newsworthy events. As well, we argue our results are driven by events
    where companies are explicitly named in media publicity, using a set of placebo
    events where no firms were identified by news coverage. Furthermore, we reject
    that our results are driven by other forms of unrest and conflict. Last, we show
    activist assassinations are positively related to the royalties paid by firms
    to domestic governments.<br><strong><br></strong><a href="https://nathanlane.github.io/assets/papers/NathanLane_New_Empirics_of_Industrial_Policy_current.pdf"
    title=""><strong>The New Empirics of Industrial Policy</strong></a><strong> (2020)
    - </strong>Review article, requested for Dani Rodrik''s volume of<strong> </strong>Journal
    of Industry, Competition and Trade.<strong><br></strong><br><strong>Abstract</strong>
    - Nations have and will continue to shape their economies through industrial policy.
    Nevertheless, the empirical literature on these interventions is thin, dwarfed
    by the attention these policies receive by policymakers across the world. In this
    paper, I discuss the difficulties of empirically studying industrial policy, and
    review how new econometric work is confronting these issues. Through careful research
    design and attention to institutional detail, I argue that emergent evaluations
    are rapidly expanding what we know—and updating what we thought we knew—about
    these policies. This review is a proposal to take industrial interventions, along
    with all their complexities, more seriously as objects of inquiry. Doing so requires
    more serious evaluations of past policy, but also a reevaluation of prior empirical
    work and consensus.Ungated version: <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tnxg6/"
